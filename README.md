Pong
====================

This is my first graphical game using pygame. Let's make Pong!

Requirements: Python 2.7, Pygame 1.9.1

How to run: python pong.py

Run options:
    --debug   Gives you control of the ball with WASD. The ball no longer moves on its own and waits for your input. Meant for testing computer AI and collision.
